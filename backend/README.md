# **Banking System**

## **Overview**

The Banking System is a secure and scalable web application designed to manage users, onboard clients, manage accounts, provide reporting, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. It is built using a modern tech stack to ensure robust performance and a seamless user experience.

### **The system supports the following core modules:**

    User Management: User registration, login, and role-based access control (RBAC).
    Client Onboarding: Collection of client information, KYC and AML checks, account creation, and notifications.
    Account Management: View and edit account information, manage transactions, generate account statements, and interest calculations.
    Reporting and Analytics: Real-time dashboards, customizable reports, and ad-hoc querying.
    Security and Compliance: Authentication, data encryption, and regulatory compliance monitoring.

## Technology Stack

### **Backend**

    Java with Spring Boot: For building scalable and secure REST APIs.
    Spring Security: To handle user authentication and authorization (role-based access control).
    Spring Data JPA/Hibernate: For database interactions.
    Apache Kafka: For real-time notifications and event-driven architecture.
    Spring Batch: For managing batch processes such as interest calculations and reporting.

### **Frontend**

    Vue.js or React.js: For building responsive and dynamic user interfaces.
        Vue.js: A lightweight and flexible framework.
        React.js: A powerful library with a rich ecosystem and community support.

### **Database (TBD)**

    Relational Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL): For structured data with relationships and strong consistency.
    NoSQL Databases (e.g., MongoDB): For unstructured or semi-structured data with high scalability.
        The final database choice will be determined based on scalability, data complexity, and use cases.

### **Security**

    OAuth 2.0 / JWT: Token-based authentication for secure user login.
    Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): For secure user authentication.
    Data Encryption: SSL/TLS encryption for data in transit and AES for data at rest.

### **APIs and Integrations**

    External KYC/AML services for compliance checks.
    Payment gateways for client transactions.

## **Features**

### **1. User Management**

   User Registration: Register users with personal details (name, email, password).
   User Login: Secure login for registered users.
   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Different roles (Admin, Banker, Client) with distinct permissions.
   User Profile Management: Users can update and manage their profile information.
   Password Management: Users can reset passwords or retrieve hints.

### **2. Client Onboarding**

   Client Information Collection: Collect personal and financial details, including identification documents.
   KYC/AML Compliance: Perform KYC and AML checks on clients for regulatory compliance.
   Account Creation: Create new accounts for clients with details such as account number, type, and balance.
   Initial Funding: Enable clients to fund their accounts via various payment methods.
   Client Notifications: Notify clients of account creation and provide login credentials.

### **3. Account Management**

   Account Information Management: Clients can view and update account information, including transaction history and balances.
   Transaction Management: Clients can perform transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers).
   Account Statement Generation: Generate and view account statements.
   Interest Calculation: Calculate and apply interest on accounts based on the account type.
   Account Closure: Clients can close accounts and receive a final statement.

### **4. Reporting and Analytics**

   Data Collection: Aggregate data from various system modules for reporting.
   Real-Time Dashboards: Customizable dashboards for clients, bankers, and administrators.
   Reports Generation: Generate performance, transaction, and client behavior reports.
   Ad-hoc Querying: Perform custom queries to retrieve specific data or reports.

### **5. Security and Compliance**

   Authentication: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for secure access.
   Authorization: Role-based access control to limit user access.
   Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
   Audit Trails: Track and log all user activities for security auditing.
   Compliance Monitoring: Continuously monitor for compliance with GDPR, PCI-DSS, and other regulations.

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

    Java 17+: For the backend application.
    Node.js and npm: For the frontend application.
    MySQL or PostgreSQL (or your preferred database).

### **Backend Setup (Spring Boot)**

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/G-Mutshidza/banking_system.git
cd banking-system/backend

### **Set up the required environment variables:**

    Database credentials (DB_URL, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD)
    JWT secret key

### **Build and run the Spring Boot application:**

    ./mvnw spring-boot:run

    The backend API will be available at http://localhost:8080.

### **Frontend Setup (Vue.js or React.js)**

    Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd banking-system/frontend

### **Install dependencies:**

npm install

#### **Start the development server:**

    npm run serve

    The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## **Usage**

### **API Documentation**

The backend exposes RESTful APIs for interacting with the system. Here are some key endpoints:

    POST /api/users/register: Register a new user.
    POST /api/users/login: Log in a registered user.
    GET /api/accounts/{id}: Get account details for a specific client.
    POST /api/transactions: Create a new transaction (deposit, withdrawal, transfer).
    GET /api/reports: Generate a financial report for a client.

For detailed API documentation, refer to the /docs directory (or Postman collection).
Security

    Data Encryption: Ensure sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
    Access Control: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions.
    Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA during user login for added security.

## **Testing**

To run tests for the backend:

./mvnw test

To run tests for the frontend (if using React.js or Vue.js):

npm run test
